# OutlookUnreadEmailsInSubfolders

A Google Chrome Extension designed for Outlook.com which allows the user to see unread emails inside an inbox folder
without expanding the tree.

It iterates through all the inbox folders, counts the unread emails inside their subfolders and shows the number of unread emails
with the parent folder so user won't have to expand the tree.
